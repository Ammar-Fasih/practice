Think of it like the difference between highway vs. city miles per gallon: SEER represents performance in perfect conditions, while SEER2 presents a more realistic picture of performance – i.e., stop-and-go traffic.

MHT™ Technology,"AirEase’s proprietary heat transfer system. A specially designed fan shroud pulls air evenly throughout the air conditioner’s coil surface. The coil features rifled tubing to enhance refrigerant flow, while lanced coil fins increase surface contact between metal and air. All combine for maximum heat transfer and efficiency."
Warranty,AirEase’s commitment to a better product is backed by a 10-Year Limited Warranty on parts.
